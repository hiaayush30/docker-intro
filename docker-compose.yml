# Use Docker Compose when your app needs multiple containers that should run together and talk to each other.
  # A web app + database (Node.js + Postgres)
  # A cache + backend + frontend (Redis + Express + React)
  # Local dev setup with multiple services (API, DB, message queue, etc.)

# postgres_ka_service is just the service name you chose.
# Itâ€™s the identifier for that container within Docker Compose.
# Other services can reach this container using that name as the hostname.
# Example: if your Node.js app wants to connect to Postgres, the hostname is postgres_ka_service (not localhost).
